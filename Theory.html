            <h2>Understanding Game Creation</h2>
            <p>Creating a game involves understanding various concepts such as characters, actions, and logic. This section will guide you through the key elements.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Characters</h2>
            <p>Characters are the central figures in your game. You can drag them from the Asset Library into your workspace. Each character can perform different actions based on your input.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Actions</h2>
            <p>Actions are the commands you give to characters. These include movements like moving left, right, up, and down, as well as turning and speaking.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Loops</h2>
            <p>A loop is a programming construct that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a specified condition or a number of iterations.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>For Loop:</strong> Executes a block of code a specific number of times.</li>
                <li><strong>While Loop:</strong> Continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
                <li><strong>Do-While Loop:</strong> Executes at least once and continues while a condition is true.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Repeating actions (e.g., moving a character multiple times).</li>
                <li>Iterating through items in a list.</li>
                <li>Automating repetitive tasks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Variables</h2>
            <p>A variable is a symbolic name for a value in programming, allowing you to store, modify, and retrieve data.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Types:</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Integer:</strong> Represents whole numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>Float:</strong> Represents decimal numbers.</li>
                <li><strong>String:</strong> Represents text.</li>
                <li><strong>Boolean:</strong> Represents true/false values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Storing changing data (e.g., player scores).</li>
                <li>Tracking game states.</li>
                <li>Facilitating user input and interaction.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Conditions</h2>
            <p>Conditions are logical statements that control the flow of execution in a program, allowing for decision-making based on whether specific criteria are met.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If Statement:</strong> Executes a block of code if a condition is true.</li>
                <li><strong>Else Statement:</strong> Executes if the preceding if condition is false.</li>
                <li><strong>Else If Statement:</strong> Tests another condition if the first is false.</li>
                <li><strong>Switch Statement:</strong> Evaluates a variable against a list of values.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Uses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Implementing game logic.</li>
                <li>Creating branching paths in gameplay.</li>
                <li>Validating user input.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Scripts</h2>
            <p>Scripts are a way to manually input commands for more complex game logic. You can write sequences of actions to define how your game operates.</p>
